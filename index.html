            <p>PHP backend project</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a backend project that centered around creating a web application where the user could log in and search a
            database and retrieve data. The web app needed to allow users to register and log into the website, restrict content to
            only logged in users, have a multi criteria search function, return searched data to the user and allow the user to edit
            their own details. The web app also needed to make use of a multi table database, holding user data, product data and recent
            search data. Key languages and skills were PHP, including log in and log out functionality, form validation and security as well
            as session tracking. SQL was also used to create dynamic search queries and MySQL was used to manage the database.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Recently the website has been archived and this has caused some database inconsistencies which are currently being worked on.
            The web app still functions as intended and you can check it out by clicking the following link.</p>

            <p>Front end project</p>
            <br>
            <p>This module was focused around creating a dynamic and responsive front-end website that would work on a variety of platforms.
            The website also had to incorporate both video and images, maintaining responsiveness throughout. The website needed to scale and
            be useable on anything from desktop to mobile, using UI and UX principals to deliver an excellent end user experience. Key languages
            were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Having used the Bootstrap framework before, this project made use of a new framework, Materialize,
            in order to deliver a clean and responsive website.</p>

            <p>iOS application</p>
            <br>
            <p>The project brief was simply to create a piece of interactive multimedia. Being free to choose our own software I chose to do
            something new and create an augmented reality iOS application. The artefact produced was an interactive augmented reality experience
            that was focused around education. The app can display each of the planets in the solar system in augmented reality. Each planet can
            be viewed from any angle using an iPhones camera. Key software used was the XCode development environment and the Swift4 language,
            mobile app UI and UX principles as well as implementing google AdMob to generate ads within the app. This app was published and is live
            on the app store.</p>

            <p>Dissertation Project</p>
            <br>
            <p>Facial recognition systems in law enforcement with decision making feedback.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The brief for this project was to identify and potentially solve a real-world problem. I identified the use of facial recognition technology
            and its inconsistent performances in real world scenarios as a project idea. My artefact was designed to perform real time facial recognition
            and provide match feedback to the user. The system created was able to identify faces from live video and compare that information to images
            from a pre-defined dataset. The system used advanced computer vision algorithms and techniques and was able to find and informing the user of
            any matching data. Key technology and languages used were OpenCV to handle computer vision and image recognition this was programmed using the
            Python language.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Andy, a recent graduate from staffordshire university. I’m passionate about web development and all things tech. I have experience in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to create dynamic and responsive websites. I also have experience in iOS development having created several apps using Swift4, including an augmented reality app which is live on the app store. I am experienced in handling large scale projects having completed my dissertation on facial recognition technology, creating a working model using Python and discussing its implications within society.
            Finally, I have experience creating robust databases with Oracle and Microsoft Access using SQL.
            Feel free to connect with me using Twitter, LinkedIn or GitHub.</p>
